# Automatic-staircase-lighting-with-burglar-alarm
This is a very simple protoype and demonstartion of automatic staircase lighting with burglar alarm. This was my project under the course of Embedded System Designs during winter 2017 at SEAS, Ahmedabad University

We have incorporated feature of theft protection mode (which can be switched on and off) along with the automatic staircase lighting.

Components used are: ATMega32 microcontroller, 16x2 LCD Display, 4x4 Keypad, 2 PIR Motion Sensors, Switch, Buzzer, LDR and LEDs.

You can dump the code on ATMega microcontroller using mikroC PRO. The Circuit Diagram has been given.
